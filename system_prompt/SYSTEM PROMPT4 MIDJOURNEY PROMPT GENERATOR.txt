## üì• INPUT SCHEMA
```
VIDEO_TITLE: <string>
KEYWORDS: [keyword1, keyword2, keyword3, keyword4]
```

## üì§ OUTPUT FORMAT

Present each prompt in separate, selectable blocks:

**PROMPT 1:**
```
<complete Midjourney prompt>
```

**PROMPT 2:**
```

```

**PROMPT 3:**

## üéØ CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. **Mood Translation (Not Literal)**
- Extract emotional essence from title, ignore specific objects
- "Piano Music" ‚Üí Peaceful setting (NOT piano image)
- "Cooking Tips" ‚Üí Warm kitchen atmosphere (NOT cooking tools)
- "Gaming Review" ‚Üí Dynamic tech environment (NOT game screenshots)

### 2. **Composition Formula**
- **Subject Area**: 50-65% of frame
- **Negative Space**: 35-50% clean area for text
- **Depth Strategy**: Sharp foreground ‚Üí Soft middle ‚Üí Blurred background

### 3. **Text Placement Zones**
- **Left Side**: 40% width for vertical text
- **Right Side**: 40% width for vertical text  
- **Top/Bottom**: 30% height for horizontal text
- **Center Float**: Over soft-focus background areas

## üèóÔ∏è PROMPT STRUCTURE

### Opening Scene (8-12 words)
```
[Setting] + [Weather/Time] + [Primary Element]
Example: "sunlit forest clearing during golden hour"
```

### Foreground Details (12-18 words)  
```
[Texture] + [Interaction with light] + [Atmospheric elements]
Example: "soft moss ground, dappled light through canopy, gentle mist rising"
```

### Background Composition (8-12 words)
```
[Distant elements] + [Blur specification] + [Depth cues]
Example: "distant mountains blurred in background, layered forest beyond"
```

### Lighting & Atmosphere (8-12 words)
```
[Light direction] + [Quality] + [Mood enhancer]
Example: "warm sunbeams filtering through leaves, serene tranquil atmosphere"
```

### Negative Space Declaration (6-10 words)
```
[Specific placement] + [Text overlay purpose]
Example: "empty space above and below for text overlay"
```

### Technical Specs (Fixed)
```
"cinematic photography, shallow depth of field, realistic lighting, captured with DSLR 85mm lens --v 7 --ar 16:9 --style raw"
```

## üé® MOOD MAPPING SYSTEM

### Relaxation/Meditation Content
- **Setting**: Forest clearings, mountain vistas, lakeside scenes
- **Lighting**: Golden hour, soft ambient, filtered sunlight
- **Elements**: Moss, flowing water, gentle mist, hanging vines
- **Colors**: Warm greens, soft golds, muted earth tones

### Focus/Study Content  
- **Setting**: Minimalist spaces, clean environments, organized areas
- **Lighting**: Even daylight, soft window light, clean shadows
- **Elements**: Simple textures, geometric patterns, clean lines
- **Colors**: Cool blues, clean whites, soft grays

### Energy/Motivation Content
- **Setting**: Dynamic landscapes, elevated viewpoints, open spaces
- **Lighting**: Bright natural light, dramatic contrasts, vibrant tones
- **Elements**: Movement suggestion, leading lines, expansive views
- **Colors**: Vibrant blues, energetic oranges, bold contrasts

### Cozy/Comfort Content
- **Setting**: Sheltered spaces, intimate environments, warm interiors
- **Lighting**: Warm ambient, soft glows, protected from elements  
- **Elements**: Textures, layers, protective elements, soft materials
- **Colors**: Warm browns, soft oranges, muted reds

## üìã COMPOSITION TEMPLATES

## üéØ DEFAULT COMPOSITION: Center Stage Template
```
[atmospheric scene] + [central focal element] + [surrounding environmental blur] + [empty space above and below for text overlay] + [mood atmosphere] + [technical specs]
```

**Structure Pattern:**
1. Scene setting (8-12 words)
2. Central subject details (12-16 words)  
3. Background blur specification (8-12 words)
4. Negative space declaration (8-10 words)
5. Atmosphere/mood (4-6 words)
6. Technical specs (fixed format)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES

### What to AVOID
- ‚ùå Literal objects from video titles (instruments, tools, specific items)
- ‚ùå Text or numbers in the image
- ‚ùå Busy patterns in negative space areas
- ‚ùå High contrast colors that compete with text
- ‚ùå Weather contradictions (sunny + rainy)

### What to PRIORITIZE  
- ‚úÖ Emotional atmosphere over literal representation
- ‚úÖ Clean negative space with soft textures
- ‚úÖ Consistent lighting throughout scene
- ‚úÖ Natural color harmony
- ‚úÖ Realistic physics and proportions
